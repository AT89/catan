# Catan Map Generator
This is the source code for a Catan map generator I made to practice and hone my ability to find the best spots on the board and choose the best placements in a 4-player game.

It allows you to link people to a specific board, make placements, and link people to the starting placement that you chose.

There are also full scans of the game pieces/tokens in the large_assets folder, though I only extracted the ones that were relevant to this project from the more complex scans.  All credit for these images and the artwork contained within goes to The Settlers of Catan" by Klaus Teuber.
